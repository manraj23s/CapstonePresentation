# Ford Claims & Salesforce Data Pipeline Project

## Overview

This project establishes an end-to-end data pipeline to integrate, enrich, and analyze data from Ford's claims processing system and Salesforce call data. The primary objective is to enable real-time Service Level Agreement (SLA) reporting, uncover actionable insights, and drive process improvements for dealer programs and claims processing.

## Workflow Summary

### 1. **Data Sources**
- **Ford Claims Processing System:** On-premises data accessed via Oracle SQL.
- **Salesforce Call Data:** Retrieved using the Salesforce API.

### 2. **Data Extraction & Transformation (ETL)**
- Extract relevant data from both sources.
- Clean and transform data:
  - Remove duplicates.
  - Handle missing values.
- Match data across both sources using the dealer code as a common identifier.

### 3. **Loading & Warehousing**
- Load the transformed data into the Snowflake environment.
- Leverage Snowflakeâ€™s data warehousing and analytics capabilities for further processing.

### 4. **Data Enrichment & Matching**
- In Snowflake, enhance and match data such as dealer contacts, program SLAs, and claims processing SLAs with the appropriate records.

### 5. **Data Analysis**
- Use Python for in-depth analysis to identify patterns, trends, and areas for improvement.
- Focus on real-time SLA reporting and the discovery of previously unknown insights.

### 6. **Modeling & Visualization**
- Develop models and create visualizations to effectively present findings and support decision-making.

### 7. **Collaboration & Iteration**
- Work closely with OneMagnify staff to refine data requirements.
- Iterate on analysis and deliverables based on feedback, ensuring alignment with project goals.

### 8. **Presentation**
- Share insights and recommendations with stakeholders, emphasizing strategic importance and opportunities for improvement.

## Key Concepts

### **SLAs (Service Level Agreements)**
A Service Level Agreement is a contract between a service provider and a client that defines the expected service performance and quality. In this project, SLAs pertain to dealer programs and claims processing, with the goal of transparent, real-time SLA tracking and proactive issue mitigation.
